This is a project for the Upenn coding bootcamp. It is a weather app that uses openweathermap.org api to get the weather forecast of the inputed city and gives you the next 5 days of forecast as well. This was written from scratch using starter code from Google and Chatgpt. Syntax and ideas were also taken from google and chatgpt.

Deployed application: https://wjollie.github.io/Upenn-Weather_Dashboard/
